\end{figure}

A bit is, in essence, an abstraction of a two-level system.
It characterizes the state space of a system restricted to two mutually distinguishable alternatives, independent of the system’s physical realization.
Within this framework, three conceptually distinct types of bits may be identified: deterministic classical bit, probabilistic classical bit, and qubit.

The state of a classical bit can be described by a single binary value $\psi$, which can be equal to either 0 or 1.
The state can be indicated by a point in one of two positions, indicated by the two points labelled 0 and 1 (see figure).

Next consider probabilistic classical bit whose value is not known exactly, but is known to be either 0 or 1 with corresponding probabilities $p_0$ and $p_1$, which satisfies $p_0+p_1=1$.
We can represent these two probabilities by the 2-dimensional unit vector
\begin{equation*}
  \psi = \begin{bmatrix}
    p_0 \\p_1
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
which does not need to belong to a Hilbert space.
In the figure, the probabilities $p_0$ and $p_1$ are represented by the position of a point on the line segment between the points representing 0 and 1.

The state of a quantum bit is described by a complex unit vector $\ket{\psi}$ in a 2-dimensional Hilbert space
\begin{equation*}
  | \psi \rangle = \cos\left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) | 0 \rangle + e^{i \phi} \sin\left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) | 1 \rangle
\end{equation*}
Such a state vector is often depicted as a point on the surface of a 3-dimensional sphere, known as the Bloch sphere,
Points on the surface of the Bloch sphere can also be expressed in Cartesian coordinates as
\begin{equation*}
  (x, y, z) = \left( \sin \theta \cos \varphi, \sin \theta \sin \varphi, \cos \theta \right)
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Quantum Gate}
In quantum computing, we refer to a unitary operator $U$ acting on a single-qubit as a 1-qubit (unitary) gate.
We can represent operators on the $2$-dimensional Hilbert space of a single qubit as $2 \times  2$ matrices.
More generally, an $n$-qubit system is described by a $2n$-dimensional Hilbert space, and operators acting on it are represented by $2^n \times 2^n$ matrices.

\subsubsection{Pauli gates.}
The Pauli gates $X$, $Y $, and $Z$ correspond to rotations about the $x$-, $y$- and $z$-axes of the Bloch sphere, respectively
\begin{align*}
  \sigma_0 \equiv I \equiv \begin{bmatrix}
                             1 & 0 \\
                             0 & 1
                           \end{bmatrix}
   &  & \sigma_1 \equiv \sigma_x \equiv X \equiv \begin{bmatrix}
                                                   0 & 1 \\
                                                   1 & 0
                                                 \end{bmatrix} \\
  \sigma_2 \equiv \sigma_y \equiv Y \equiv \begin{bmatrix}
                                             0 & -i \\
                                             i & 0
                                           \end{bmatrix}
   &  & \sigma_3 \equiv \sigma_z \equiv Z \equiv \begin{bmatrix}
                                                   1 & 0  \\
                                                   0 & -1
                                                 \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

The $X$ operator is also known as $\mathrm{NOT}$ whose action is to map $\ket{0}$ to $\ket{1}$ and  $\ket{1}$ to $\ket{0}$.
\begin{equation*}
  \mathrm{NOT} :  \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation*}
The \(Y\) operator combines a bit flip with a phase.
Its action maps \(\ket{0}\) to \(i\ket{1}\) and \(\ket{1}\) to \(-i\ket{0}\).
\begin{equation*}
  Y : \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ i \end{bmatrix},
  \quad
  \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix} -i \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation*}
The \(Z\) operator is known as the phase-flip operator. Its action is to leave \(\ket{0}\) unchanged while introducing a relative phase of \(-1\) on \(\ket{1}\).
\begin{equation*}
  Z : \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix},
  \quad
  \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation*}
The identity operator \(I\) acts trivially on the computational basis and leaves all states unchanged.
\begin{equation*}
  I : \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix},
  \quad
  \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection{CNOT.}
The $\mathrm{CNOT}$ gate is a 2-qubit unitary gate.
It acts on an ordered pair of qubits: a control qubit (first bit)and a target qubit (second bit).
Its defining property is that it applies a $\mathrm{NOT}$ $X$ operation to the target qubit if and only if the control qubit is in the state $\ket{1}$.
Formally, in the computational basis  the action of the CNOT gate is
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{CNOT}:
  \begin{matrix}
    \ket{00} \mapsto \ket{00} \\
    \ket{01} \mapsto \ket{01}
  \end{matrix}
  \qquad
  \begin{matrix}
    \ket{10} & \mapsto \ket{11} \\
    \ket{11} & \mapsto \ket{10}
  \end{matrix}
\end{align*}
Acting on separable states, it can generate entanglement, for example
\begin{equation*}
  \mathrm{CNOT}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(|0\rangle + |1\rangle\right) \otimes |0\rangle\right) =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(|00\rangle + |11\rangle\right)
\end{equation*}
which is an entangled Bell state.

\subsection{Bloch Sphere}
Pure states of a qubit can be represented by points on the surface of the Bloch sphere, while mixed states correspond to points in the interior of the Bloch sphere.
If the mixed state and the Bloch vector respectively described as
\begin{equation*}
  \rho= \sum_i p_i \bra{\psi_i}\ket{\psi_i} \qquad \ket{\psi_i} = \left( \alpha_{x_i} , \alpha_{y_i}, \alpha_{z_i}\right)
\end{equation*}
then the Bloch vector for the mixed state is
\begin{equation*}
  \rho = \sum_{i} p_i(\alpha_{x_i}, \alpha_{y_i}, \alpha_{z_i}) = \left( \sum_{i} p_i \alpha_{x_i}, \sum_{i} p_i \alpha_{y_i}, \sum_{i} p_i \alpha_{z_i} \right)
\end{equation*}
any density operator for a single qubit can be written as
\begin{equation*}
  \rho = \frac{1}{2} I + \alpha_x X + \alpha_y Y + \alpha_z Z=\frac{1 }{2 }I +\boldsymbol{\alpha} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}
\end{equation*}
and the vector $\left( \alpha_{x} , \alpha_{y}, \alpha_{z}\right)$ gives the coordinates for the point in the Bloch sphere corresponding to the state $\rho$.
