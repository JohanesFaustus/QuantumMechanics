\begin{quotation}
    The state of the particle is represented by a vector $\ket{\psi(t)}$ in a Hilbert space.
\end{quotation}
Compare it with the classical mechanics postulate via Hamiltonian formalism
\begin{quotation}
    The state of a particle at any given time is specified by the two variables $x(t)$ and $p(t)$, i.e., as a point in a two-dimensional phase space.
